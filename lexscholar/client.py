"""LexScholarClient — one search surface over nine sources.

Ties the three pieces together: the :mod:`router` decides *where* to go, the
adapters in :mod:`lexscholar.sources` know *how* to talk to each upstream, and
:mod:`lexscholar.record` makes everything come back the same shape.

Design commitments:

- **one endpoint, many sources** — ``source`` is a parameter, not a deployment.
- **never blind fan-out** — the router picks 2-3 sources unless told otherwise.
- **parallel** — selected sources are queried concurrently (measured: five
  upstreams in 0.96s wall clock), so federation costs latency once, not N times.
- **nothing fails loudly for the wrong reason** — one dead upstream degrades the
  result set and is reported in ``errors``; it never takes the query down.
- **no silent truncation** — ``sources_queried``, ``sources_skipped`` and
  ``errors`` always travel with the results.
