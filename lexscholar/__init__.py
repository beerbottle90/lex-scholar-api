"""lexscholar — federated, dependency-free client for open-access legal scholarship.

One search surface over nine no-auth sources (DOAJ, Law Review Commons, SciELO,
HAL, Dialnet, OpenAIRE, Crossref, Unpaywall, OpenAlex), with a deterministic
router that picks the 2-3 that fit each question.

See ``API.md`` for the verified upstream reference and ``README.md`` for usage.
